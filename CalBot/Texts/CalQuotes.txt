I don't envy you, that is one bad curse.
Curses are tough. You're gonna have a very hard time getting rid of that one.
Let me guess, the curse won't allow you to talk about it?
I'm an extemely powerful fire demon! And this is what you ask of me?
If you break the spell that's on me, I'll break the spell that's on you.
Demons don't make promises.
Come on! You should feel sorry for me! That spell keeps me stuck here!
You treat me like I'm a slave! "You gotta keep the water hot, keep the rooms warm, and keep the place moving...". It burns me up!
Sigh. Some big help you are...
Did you just wander in here from the Wastes?
I'm not taking any orders from you blrrppt!
I DON'T COOK! I'm SCARY and POWERFUL fire demon!
Blebleblebleahhhhh!
Wait a second, you're all just gonna sit while I do all the work?!
Fine. Like moving the castle isn't hard enough...
If I die, Howl dies too I hope you know.
Of course. No one else does any work around here.
You like my spark?
Are you okay? You smell terrible.
I can't stand the fire and gunpowder. Those dopey guys have no manners.
Wasting all my hot water again?
Stop staring at me, it's freaking me out.
It's wet here!
Aw. The wood is all damp.
I need something of yours... how about your eyes?
Imagine what I could've done with your eyes... or your heart!
Be gentle with me. Please.
Don't you seriously want your heart eaten?
May I suggest a contract?
I kinda missed you guys... and it looks like it's gonna rain.
Here's another curse - may all your bacon burn.
Howl is pretty heartless, you know.
Do you have a dry log or two?
