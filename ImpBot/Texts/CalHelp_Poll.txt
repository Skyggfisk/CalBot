# Hello there! Alright so, this "poll" thing, right...
# =================================================================

So to start off. This is a simple straw poll.

  > c!poll "pancakes or waffles" pancakes waffles

Would create a poll called PANCAKES OR WAFFLES, giving you the option to vote for either PANCAKES or WAFFLES.
You vote like this:

  > c!vote "pancakes or waffles" pancakes

This would add a vote for PANCAKES on the poll in question.
Assuming you started the poll, you could then end it like so:

  > c!endpoll "pancakes or waffles"

This would end the polling and broadcast the final results to chat. Hurray!

Additional notes:
Quotation marks are used here to incase a poll name. If your poll's name is a single word, these are unnecessary.
You can add any amount of poll options you like, not just two.
To end a poll without broadcasting results use CancelPoll <PollName>. Becareful though, this will lose all the votes, and you'll have to start over.
